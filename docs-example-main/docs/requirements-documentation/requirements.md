- The database must consist of a single tasks table, with columns for the task name, description, due date, completion status, and "urgent" flag.
- The backend server must use the Flask-SQLAlchemy library to interact with the database and perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on the tasks.
- The user interface must display a list of tasks, with the ability to filter and sort the tasks by various criteria, such as task name, due date, or category.

- The user interface must allow users to create, edit, and delete categories or lists to organize their tasks.
- Each task must be displayed in a card-like layout, with the task name, description, and due date displayed prominently.
- The user interface must have a search function that allows users to search for tasks by task name or description.
- The user interface must have an "urgent" flag that can be set for tasks, which will cause the tasks to be displayed in a different color to indicate their high priority status.
- The application must have a notification system that sends reminders to users via email or push notification when a task is approaching its due date.
- The application must have a secure login system to protect user data, using industry-standard encryption techniques.
