# Implementation details

The to-do list application will use a MySQL database to store the tasks and other application data. The database will consist of a single tasks table, with columns for the task title, description, due date, and completion status. The backend server will use the Flask-SQLAlchemy library to interact with the database and perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on the tasks.

# Testing

The to-do list application will be tested using a combination of automated and manual testing techniques. Automated tests will be written using the Pytest framework and will cover a range of scenarios, including creation and completion of tasks, filtering and sorting of tasks, and error handling. Manual testing will be performed by a team of testers who will manually test the application on a range of devices and browsers to ensure that it works as expected.

# Deployment

The to-do list application will be deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine running Ubuntu Linux. The application will be containerized using Docker and deployed using a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. The pipeline will be configured to automatically deploy new versions of the application whenever code changes are made and pushed to the repository.

# Maintenance

The to-do list application will be maintained by a team of developers who will be responsible for fixing any bugs, adding new features, and ensuring that the application remains up-to-date. The team will use a agile development process, with regular updates and releases to keep the application fresh and useful for users.
